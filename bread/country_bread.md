# Country Bread
## Ingredients
										        baker's percentage
- White flour				900 g		90
- Whole Wheat flour	100 g		10
- Sourdough 				200	g		20 
- water 					  750 g		75
- salt						   20 g		2

## Preparation
1. Mix flour, sourdough and 700 g of water together
2. Rest 40 minutes @ 80F
3. Incorporate the salt dissolved in 50g of warm water to the dough
4. Rest 3 to 4 hours @ 80F (bulk fermentation), give 2 turn in the first hour, 1 turn in the second hour
5. Form the loaf
6. Rest 3 to 4 hours @ 80F for final rise
7. Bake in a Dutch oven, preheated in the oven at 450F. 20 min @ 450F with lid. 20 min @450F without lid

## Notes
* Baker's percentage are quantity express in fraction of the flour weight
* Feed the sourdough the day before, the sourdough need to pass the float test. The float test is passed if some sourdough float after being dropped in water
* Recipe could be easily simplified by skipping a few step:
** Dissolved salt in water can be added at step 1., it hinders a bit the flour hydratation, but it's ok. Then skip to step 4.
** Turn can be skipped, gluten will be a bit less devlopped and the loaf held less, but it's ok.
