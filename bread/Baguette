# Baguette
## Ingredients
										          baker's percentage
- All-purpose flour		650 g		65
- Bread flour				  350 g		35
- Sourdough/leaven		400	g		40 
- Poolish					    400 g		40
- water 					    500 g		50
- salt						     24 g		 2.4

## Preparation
0. Perform a float test on both leavan and sourdough
1. Mix flour, sourdough, poolish and 500 g of water together
2. Rest 40 minutes @ 80F for autolize
3. Incorporate the salt dissolved in 25g of warm water to the dough
4. Rest 2-3 hours @ 80F (bulk fermentation), give 2 turn in the first hour, 1 turn in the second hour
5. Form the baguette
6. Rest 1 to 2 hours @ 80F for final rise
7. Bake in a preheated and water saturated in the oven at 500F for 15 min @ 450F . 20 min @450F without lid
8. Bake for 15 min @ 450F in non-saturated oven

## Notes
* Baker's percentage are quantity express in fraction of the flour weight
* Feed the sourdough the day before, the sourdough need to pass the float test. The float test is passed if some sourdough float after being dropped in water
* Recipe could be easily simplified by skipping a few step:
** Dissolved salt in water can be added at step 1., it hinders a bit the flour hydratation, but it's ok. Then skip to step 4.
** Turn can be skipped, gluten will be a bit less devlopped and the loaf held less, but it's ok.
